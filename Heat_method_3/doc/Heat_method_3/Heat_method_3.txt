This chapter describes the algorithm behind the Heat Method \cgalCite{cgal:cww-ghnac-13} and the algorithm behind Intrinsic Delaunay Triangulation \cgalCite{cgal:fsbs-acidt-06}.

The Heat Method is an algorithm that solves the multiple-source shortest path problem by returning the distance from the points in the domain to the closest point in the source set.
This algorithm computes this by first determining the direction along which distance increases and finishes by recovering the actual distance.
The Heat Method is more efficient and more robust than previous distance computations, as the algorithm boils down to two standard, numerical linear algebra problems.

In Section \ref sec_HM_definitions we give some definitions. In Section \ref sec_HM_history we explain the design of the algorithm and traits.

Note that this package requires the third party library <a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html#thirdpartyEigen">Eigen</a>.
This implementation is based on \cgalCite{cgal:cww-ghnac-13} and \cgalCite{cgal:fsbs-acidt-06}

\section sec_HM_definitions Definitions
Section \ref Subsection_HM_Definitions_Intro gives an overview of the theory needed by the heat method. The Section
\ref Subsection_HM_IDT_Definitions gives the background needed for the Intrinsic Delaunay Triangulation.

\subsection Subsection_HM_Definitions_Intro The Heat Method Algorithm
For a detailed overview of the heat method, the reader may consult \cgalCite{cgal:cww-ghnac-13} to read the original article. In the sequel, we introduce the basic notions so as to explain our algorithms. In general, the heat method is applicable to any setting if there exists a gradient operator \f$ \nabla\f$, a divergence operator \f$\nabla\f$ and a Laplace operator \f$\Delta = \nabla \cdot \nabla\f$
which are standard derivatives from vector calculus.

The Heat Method consists of three main steps:
   Algorithm:
           -# Integrate the heat flow \f$ \dot u = \Delta u\f$ for some fixed time \f$t\f$.
           -# Evaluate the vector field   \f$ X = -\nabla u_t / |\nabla u_t| \f$.
           -# Solve the Poisson Equation \f$ \Delta \phi = \nabla \cdot X \f$.


The function \f$ \phi \f$ is an approximation of the distance to the given source set and approaches the true distance as t goes to zero.
The algorithm must then be translated in to a discrete algorithm by replacing the derivatives in space and time with approximations.

The heat equation can be discretized in time using a single backward Euler step. This means the following equation must be solved:

      -\f$(id-t\Delta)u_t = \delta(x) \f$ where \delta(x) is a Dirac delta encoding an 'infinite' spike of heat (1 if x is in the source set, 0 otherwise)
        over the entire domain M, where id is the identity operator.

The heat equation is discretized in space depending on the structure. For this package, we use triangle meshes exclusively. Let \f$ u \in \R^{|V|}\f$ specify a piecewise linear function on a triangulated surface with vertices \f$V\f$, edges \f$E\f$ and faces \f$F\f$.
A standard discretization of the Laplacian at vertex \f$i\f$ is:

    -\f$ {Lu}_i = \frac{1}{2A_i} \sum_{j}(cot \alpha_{ij} + cot \beta_{ij})(u_j-u_i)\f$ where \f$A_i\f$ is one third the area of all triangles incident on vertex \f$i\f$.

The sum is taken over all of the neighboring vertices \f$j\f$. Further, \f$\alpha_{ij}\f$ and \f$\beta_{ij}\f$ are the angles opposing the corresponding edge \f$ij\f$. We express this operation via a matrix \f$L = M^{-1}L_c\f$ where \f$M \in R^{|V|x|V|}\f$ is a diagonal matrix containing the vertex areas and \f$L_c \in R^{|V|x|V|} \f$ is the cotan operator representing the remaining sum.

From this, the symmetric positive-definite system \f$(M-tL_C)u = \delta_{\gamma}\f$ can be solved to find \f$u\f$ where \f$\delta_{\gamma}\f$ is the Kronecker delta over \f$\gamma\f$.

Next, the gradent in a given triangle can be expressed as:

\f$\nabla \cdot X = \frac{1}{2} \sum_j cot\theta_1 (e_1 \cdot X_j) + cot \theta_2 (e_2 \cdot X_j)\f$

where the sum is taken over incident triangles \f$j\f$ each with a vector \f$X_j\f$, \f$e_1\f$ and \f$e_2\f$ are the two edge vectors of triangle \f$j\f$ containing \f$i\f$ and \f$\theta_1\f$, \f$\theta_2\f$ are the opposing angles.

Finally, let \f$b \in R^{|V|}\f$ be the integrated divergences of the normalized vector field X. Thus, solving the symmetric Poisson problem \f$ L_c \phi = b\f$ computes the final distance function.

\subsection Subsection_HM_IDT_Definitions Intrinsic Delaunay Triangulation
  The standard discretization of the cotan laplace operator uses the cotangents of the angles in the triangle mesh. The intrinsic Delaunay triangulation is used to address extreme angles in the mesh.
    - An edge of a mesh is locally Delaunay if the sum of the cotangents of the opposing angles is greater than or equal to 0. A mesh is Delaunay if all of its edges are locally Delaunay.

  A standard algorithm to convert a given planar triangulation into a Delaunay triangulation is to flip non-Delaunay edges in a mesh until the mesh is Delaunay. Similarly, the intrinsic Delaunay triangulation of a simplicial \f$R^3\f$ surface is constructed by performing intrinsic edge flips.

  - An intrinsic property is a byproduct of only the topology of the mesh. That is, the property does not change if the way the mesh is represented changes. For example, edge lengths and angles are intrinsic whereas vertex coordinates and orientation are extrinsic.

  The intrinsic Delaunay triangulation thus relies on edge lengths and angles, as does the heat method. The intrinsic Delaunay triangulation does not actually flip the edge. Instead, the edge flips are intrinsic and so the shape of the original embedded mesh does not change. Instead, the IDT mesh is considered as an abstract surface with a locally Euclidean metric. Instead of actually flipping an edge, the algorithm performs a combinatorial flip on it and updates its length. Thus, there is no change to the intrinsic geometry of the input mesh.

  Let \f$ K = (V,E,T) \f$ be a 2-manifold triangle mesh, where \f$V\f$ is the vertex set, \f$ E \f$ is the edge set and \f$ T \f$ is the face set (triangle set). Let \f$ L \f$ be the set of Euclidean distances, where \f$ L(e_{ij}) = l_{ij} = || p_i - p_j || \f$ , where \f$ p_i \f$ and \f$ p_j \f$ are the point positions \f$ \in R^3 \f$ of vertices \f$ i \f$ and \f$ j \f$ respectively. Then, let the pair \f$ (K,L) \f$ be the input to the iDT algorithm which returns the pair \f$(\dot K, \dot L)\f$, which are the intrinsic Delaunay mesh and the intrinsic lengths. The algorithm is as follows:

             \f$ \forall e \in E : Mark(e) \f$

             Stack \f$ s \leftarrow E \f$

             while !Empty(\f$s\f$) do

               \f$e_{ij} \leftarrow \f$ Pop(\f$s\f$) and Unmark(\f$e_ij\f$)

                if !Delaunay(\f$e_{ij}\f$) then

                  \f$e_{kl} \leftarrow\f$ Flip(\f$e_ij\f$) and compute the new length \f$l_{kl}\f$

                   for all \f$e \in {e_{kj}, e_{jl}, e_{li}, e_{ik}}\f$ do

                     if !Mark(\f$e\f$) then

                       Mark(\f$e\f$) and Push(\f$s,e\f$)

                     end if

                  end for

                end if

              end while

            return \f$(\dot K, \dot L)\f$ \f$\leftarrow (K,L)\f$

  The new \f$(\dot K, \dot L)\f$ are used in the Heat Method distance computation.
