This chapter describes the algorithm behind the Heat Method \cgalCite{cgal:cww-ghnac-13} and the algorithm behind Intrinsic Delaunay Triangulation \cgalCite{cgal:fsbs-acidt-06}.

The Heat Method is an algorithm that solves the multiple-source shortest path problem by returning the distance from the points in the domain to the closest point in the source set.
This algorithm computes this by first determining the direction along which distance increases and finishes by recovering the actual distance.
The Heat Method is more efficient and more robust than previous distance computations, as the algorithm boils down to two standard, numerical linear algebra problems.


In Section \ref sec_HM_definitions we give some definitions. In Section \ref sec_HM_history we explain the design of the algorithm and traits.

Note that this package requires the third party library <a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html#thirdpartyEigen">Eigen</a>.
This implementation is based on \cgalCite{cgal:cww-ghnac-13} and \cgalCite{cgal:fsbs-acidt-06}

\section sec_HM_definitions Definitions
Section \ref Subsection_HM_Definitions_Intro gives an overview of the structures needed by the heat method and how to calculate them. The Section
\ref Subsection_HM_IDT_Definitions gives the background needed for the Intrinsic Delaunay Triangulation.
