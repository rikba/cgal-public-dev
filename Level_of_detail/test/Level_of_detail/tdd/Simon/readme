To use the code:

A --------

In my case, I have the directory with the folders:

1. "cgal-public-dev" folder - here the LOD branch is stored
2. "cgal-build" folder - here CGAL is build

B --------

In this directory, I create three folders:

1. "data" - I copy here my data from Google drive
2. "logs" - inside this folder I create a folder "tmp", where all intermediate steps of the pipeline are stored
3. "tdd-build" - here I compile the test code to run the pipeline

C --------

I need to define one environment variable "LOD_LOG_PATH" - path to the "logs" folder above

D --------

Now, I go to the folder "tdd-build"

To compile the test on Mac OS, I do in my terminal (not sure how it should be on Linux):

run cmake for the "CMakeLists.txt" in the "Simon" folder
make
./lod

or

./lod -param_name param_value (can be found in the main.cpp)

or use "-help" for all available options
