To use the code:

A --------

In my case, I have a directory with folders:

1. "cgal-public-dev" folder - here the LOD branch is stored
2. "build" folder - here CGAL is build

B --------

In this directory, I create three folders:

1. "data" - I copy here my data folders from Google drive
2. "logs" - inside this folder I create a folder "tmp", where all intermediate steps of the pipeline are stored
3. "tdd-build" - here I compile the test code to run the pipeline

I also copy to this directory the file "compile-tdd.sh" that can be found in the current folder

C --------

a. First, I go to the folder: cgal-public-dev/Level_of_detail/test/Level_of_detail/tdd/Pierre (current folder)
b. I open main.cpp
c. I edit "data_path" at the beginning of the "main()" function. E.g. data_path = "/Users/danisimo/Documents/pipeline/data/"

a. Second, I go to the folder cgal-public-dev/Level_of_detail/include/CGAL/Mylog/
b. I open Mylog.h
c. I edit the path "m_prefix_path" at the very top of the file

D --------

Now I go to the directory from A.

To compile the test, I do in my terminal (not sure how it should be on Windows):

cd tdd-build
sh ../compile-tdd.sh Pierre
make
./lod 

or

./lod -param_name param_value (can be found in the main.cpp)


So, it should be enough to make it work. But, in any case I will help you.
