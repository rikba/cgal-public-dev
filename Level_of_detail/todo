Todo:
1. Refactor the LOD reconstruction class.
2. Make the final LOD result (polyhedron) a valid manifold mesh.
3. Refactor all steps of the pipeline.
4. Check in each class that I do not have duplicated input points or handle these duplications.
5. Reimplement the polygonizer class of Jean-Philippe.
6. Clean this branch.

Refactoring:
1. Change Level_of_detail_reconstruction to Level_of_detail.
2. Put the Level_of_detail with all includes in the outside folder CGAL.
3. Data structure should have only point map and input.
4. Change three default selection classes to one property map that maps user-defined data to the enumeration {IN, OUT, BOUNDARY, VEGETATION}.
Internally, I can do a for loop to save all indices to the correct data structures.
5. Move normal map and/or lable map to the build function or wherever they are needed.
6. Keep verbose.
7. Remove selection and put this behaviour in the data folder of tools smth like splitting semantic data.
