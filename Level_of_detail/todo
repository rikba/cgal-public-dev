TODO:
1. Fix #include <Point_set_3> for boost::tie dependency. Change it to the proper boost inclusion.
2. Redo selector class using property maps.
3. Selector class currently copies the input point cloud, so it may be slow.
4. For now I use built in conditions inside selection strategy classes. Change it to any custom condition later.
