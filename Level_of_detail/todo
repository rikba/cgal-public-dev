TODO:
1. Fix #include <Point_set_3> for boost::tie dependency. Change it to the proper boost inclusion.
2. Redo selector class using property maps.
3. For now I use built in conditions inside selection strategy classes. Change it to any custom condition later.
4. When I fit a plane to the ground in the base class, I need to copy all ground points. Change it!
5. Refactor the preprocessor class.
6. Fix where I use Container::Index and where int.
7. Update Level_of_detail_loader.h - currently it is fixed temporary implementation.
8. Instead of the first normal in regularization step, I need to take an average normal.
