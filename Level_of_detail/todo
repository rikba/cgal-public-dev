Todo:
1. Refactor the LOD reconstruction class.
2. Fix the natural neighbours issue.
3. Fix the projection issue.
4. Make the final LOD result (polyhedron) a valid manifild mesh.
5. Refactor all steps of the pipeline.
6. Check in each class that I do not have duplicated input points or handle these duplications.
7. Reimplement the polygonizer class of Jean-Philippe.
